Google AI Hackathon 2024 Project: Conversation Dictionary

Welcome to the Conversation Dictionary, a dynamic tool designed to help language learners see vocabulary in action. Whether you’re a beginner or mastering a language, this tool allows you to input any word and see it used within a realistic conversation. Simply choose the language you're learning, your proficiency level, and type in the word you wish to explore.

Here's how it works:

1. Select Your Language and Level: Start by specifying the language you are learning (like Chinese or Spanish) and your proficiency level (from A1 Beginner to C2 Mastery).
2. Request a Word or Phrase: Enter the word or phrase you're curious about.
3. Customize the Context: You can further tailor the experience by providing a specific context, such as "ordering food at a restaurant" or "asking for directions."
4. Adjust Formality and Translation Options: Choose the formality of the conversation from informal to formal and decide if you want English translations included.

Once set up, click "Find Conversation" to generate a dialogue featuring your chosen vocabulary. This tool is perfect for seeing how words fit into everyday conversations, making it easier to understand and remember them.

This application, developed during the Google AI Hackathon 2024, uses advanced AI to create realistic and contextually appropriate dialogues. It’s an invaluable resource for anyone involved in language learning or teaching.
